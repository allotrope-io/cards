# Cram Cards
The official repository for Cram Cards, a spaced repetition memorization software designed to be easy to use and for users to also learn and organise the information being learned. Inspired by [Anki](https://github.com/ankitects/anki), but with an emphasis on **learning**, **ease of use**, and **deck sharing**. 

Until this project is up-and-running, get the [Anki app](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) to get started. One key feature of Anki is that its data structure is open source and can be freely moved to other services. Inline with this methodology, Anki decks will be able to be imported into Cram Cards, and Cram Card sets will in turn be able to be exported, ready for systems like Anki. 

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute to the project! I'm not strong with unit testing or immaculate code foundations, so any help in that area would be greatly appreciated. Please push to the `staging` branch, where I can review your contributions before being deployed live. You can see the staging branch live at [https://dev.cram.cards/](https://dev.cram.cards/).

#### Technologies
This software is built using NextJS, React, and Firebase. The eventual hope is for it to be both a desktop PWA (for frequent users to quickly create cards or review their sets) and a website with SEO for users to create decks (e.g. for a specific course) and have classmates discover said decks (and Cram Cards!) when searching for that course through search engines.

## Licensing
Not decided as of yet, but am evaluating open source copyleft licenses. Special features, through so called "plugins", will not necessarily be open source (data format aside).
